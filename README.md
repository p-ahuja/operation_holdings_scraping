# operation_holdings_scraping

### Main file: loop.py 

Purpose: scrapes data from https://agcensus.dacnet.nic.in/tehsilsummarytype.aspx with the following details: 

State: all states

District: all districts

Tehsil: all tehsils

Tables: Number and area of operation holdings by size groups

Social group: all social groups 

Gender:  Total

Table Unit: Number


High level explanation: Loops through all states, districts, tehsils and submits the form on the website; fetches the resulting table as a csv file and downloads it to dropbox 

### Secondary file: interface_trackers.py 

Purpose: includes three helper functions 

### Other files are either (1) unspecific to the website or (2) not imported in the main file, loop.py, so unused

### Requirements
Refer to requirements.txt for necessary python libraries/installments; refer to the import statements in loop.py to understand while files are unused 

### Before you run: 
1. Create a directory called log_files and, inside it, a file called log_number.txt where the first line says 1; each time the code runs, a new log file will be created in log_files and the number in log_number.txt will be incremented
2. Create a directory called saved_tables; each time a file is downloaded from the website, a csv file with the information from the table will be created in saved_tables; you do not have to populate saved_tables with anything before running the code
3. Create a directory called state_trackers; each time an attempt is unsuccessful, it will be document in a file called <STATE>_unsucsessful.txt in state_trackers; you do not have to populate state_trackers with anything before running the code
4. No need to change the directory called trackers
5. Create a file called last_done.txt and input the first configuration in the form
   
YEAR
STATE

DISTRICT

TEHSIL; 

This file updates each iteration with the details of the most recently scraped table; if the code terminates unexpectedly, it will re-run and start from the year, state, district and tehsil listed in last_done.txt 

### To run: python3 loop.py (command line)
